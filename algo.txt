1. FIll "=" sign
2. we know from question, one more position.
3. 2 positions remain with 2 signs, so 4 combinations possible
4. >>>,<<<, ><<, <>>
5. Use the Letter with "=" sign as starting point and fill its positions
6. Go to D and complete its 2 positions by taking inverse of signs from letter not containing "="
THen fill the remaining 2 letters with the other 2 possibilites



New rules:
1. Letter with = sign is filled with inverse or all others. 
2. There is always 2 > and 1 <.
3. < is always filled with same values. 
4. Other letter whose sign is in same position as = in the inital letter , the answer for that is inverse of remainiing values
5. final letter is filled by the last possibility
